# Concepts of Anagram

While there are, of course, different ways to attack this problem the
'canonical' way is to write a function that "normalizes" the
candidates and the input word so that they can then be easily
compared. It is this method which was reviewed for concepts. (ref. the
[exercism v2 common-lisp track exercise][v2-exercise].)

## Concepts

- Sequences
- Strings
- Higher-order functions
- Equality
- Sorting
- Filtering (via `find-if` or `remove-if`)
- Anonymous Functions (optionally)
